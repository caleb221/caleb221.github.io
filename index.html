               I am a Teacher at JPII Catholic Highschool in New Braunfels.<br>
                I previously taught at the St. Paul American Highschool<br>
                in Shanghai China for two years.
             <br>
                The courses I teach are all related to the Science and Technologies
                <br>
                I have learned from my students almost as much as I have taught them.
                <br>
                Seeing my students create code and implement data structures has been
                <br>
                one of my life's greatest achievements.

            <p> 
            I Majored in Applied Physics and Minored in Computer Science.
            <br>
            But it was not until I started working at SouthWest Research Institute
            <br> 
            that I really learned how to compute.
            <br>
            I went on to teach multiple Highschool courses in Computer Science and Robotics.
            <br>
            My development has come from real world experience,
            <br>
            trial and error, help from some of the smartest people I know, classes,
            <br>
            and an unmentionable amount of coffee.

            I started working at SouthWest Research Institute during my freshman year of college.
            <br>
            this is where my training as an Analyst began.
            <br>
            I learned while working with the 
                <span title="Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter, Lyman Alpha Mapping Project" style="color: aqua;">LRO/LAMP</span> team.
            <br>
            My primary directive here was to take care LAMP's Imaging Spectrometer instrument calibration.
            <br>
            I also had the opportunity to develop the server side code for
            <br>
            a special data feature that had unknown causes.
            <br>
            Spoiler alert:
            <br>
            it came down to black body radiation not being perfect at
            <br>
            some geometries with the earth and sun.

            Change is the only constant.
            <br>
            This is something that I believe, and it applies to all aspects of my life.
            <br>
            I believe that change is something that directly applies to travelling.
            <br>
            Cultures across the world have inspired me to see things both differently
            <br>
            and innovatively.
            <br>
            I lived in china for <span title="as of making this w" style="color:blanchedalmond;">3.5 Years</span>
            <br>
            and it was one of the greatest experience of my life.
            <br>
            from different foods, different lifestyles, social normatives, and cultures
            <br>
                in general, I have found that we are all uniquely different.
            <br>
            I think we should celebrate these differences, as well as our 
            <br>
            commonalities, which i find usually we have more than we think.
            <br>
            What are you waiting for? The world is right outside the door!
